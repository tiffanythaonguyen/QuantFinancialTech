# Application of SQL Queries in Financial Technologies

## Overview
This GitHub repository aims to demonstrate the application of SQL queries in financial technologies, specifically focusing on utilizing SQL in Jupyter for AI and machine learning projects related to quantitative finance. The repository will also include a Finance Forward reflection paper and a quantitative economy section. The project will be implemented in Python using pandas, yfinance packages, open-source finance-related datasets or APIs, R language, and SQLalchemy.
